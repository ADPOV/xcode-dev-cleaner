        <h3>What is DevCleaner?</h3>
        <p>DevCleaner is a tool that allows you to reclaim tens of gigabytes of your storage used for various Xcode caches.</p>
        <p>Xcode could store massive amount of data in <code>~/Developer</code> folder. Most of those cached files & symbols are not reclaimed over time and could consume a large amount of your storage, which is especially important if you have relatively small SSD drive.</p>
        <p>DevCleaner gives you an easy way to inspect auto-generated files and clean them if necessary. It could also remind you about scan after a while.</p>
        <p>Please note that <b>this application is relying on internal folder structures and undocumented features</b>. It could stop working with newer versions of Xcode! I tried to make sure this application is safe, but if you want to be sure, please <b>make backup before use it</b>.</p>
